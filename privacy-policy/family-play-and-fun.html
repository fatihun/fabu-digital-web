            <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Family: Play & Fun</strong> app (hereby referred to as
                "Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Fabu Digital</strong> (hereby referred to
                as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>The Application is designed to be safe for families and children. We prioritize user privacy and minimize
                data collection.</p>

            <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
                <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
                <li>General usage data (e.g., time spent on the application) to help us improve the app experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>The Application does NOT collect precise location data.</strong></p>

            <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
            <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service
                Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information
                with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

            <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about
                handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by
                the Application:</p>

                Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service
                Provider processes and maintains.</p>

            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you
                of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised
